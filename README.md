# Baggins Bot

This is hosted on Heroku and runs as a Discord Bot.

Users can pretext their messages with bb! and then an image attachment. 

Once users have uploaded their image to Discord with the appropriate tag, it is read by the bot, and using Googles Image to Text API, the text is extracted from the image.

The bot is then built to extract specific values using regex, in line with ROK statistic pages.
